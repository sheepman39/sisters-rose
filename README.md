This is just a collection of mods for a personal modded server.

I do not claim ownership of any of the above mods.  They were made by their respective owners.

In order to install the mods, first install Forge for 1.12.
Instructions to install Forge can be found here: http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html

Once it is installed, click on the green button that says 'code' and download it as a zip file.  
Depending on your operating system, go to the Minecraft folder, then click on mods and extract the zip file in there.  You may have to go into the folder it produces and move the mods to the mod folder.
